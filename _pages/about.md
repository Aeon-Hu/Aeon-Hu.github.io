## PROFILE

Fourth-year international student in UTM Department of Computational and Mathematical Science having a solid foundation in mathematics and analytical thinking, and able to efficiently tackle complex challenges, currently interested in applied mathematics. <br />
In addition, I have experience in various areas of game design, including UI, map, narrative, and character design. Since 2018, I've been designing original characters and am currently focused on enhancing gameplay depth, such as interactive items and multi-ending storylines. If you're interested in my design works, please move to the “Sample Design” page. The game only has Chinese version for now and is still under development. If you are interested in trying a demo of the game (a sample room), please contact aeon20030330@gmail.com.
